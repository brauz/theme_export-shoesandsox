These ranges determine the sole of the shoe based on research into a child’s walking development based on their age group. A Step Up sole starts at a European (EU) 19 and finishes at EU22. This type of sole unit is for little ones beginning to walk, cruising or wearing shoes for the first time. After Step Up comes IWalk – this sole is firmer for our more advanced walkers starting at EU22 and finishing at EU26. Finally, there’s Kid+ starting at EU27 and finishing at EU30. Bobux is generally a longer make and so we usually recommend sticking to the measured size. Bobux are usually made of genuine leather – a softer material that makes for a more comfortable fit straight away rather than wearing the shoes in to soften them over time (this is sometimes required for particular styles). The Bobux Jodhpur is very popular each Winter season and comes in an array of different colours (this season this style comes in seven different colours) and is complete with pull tabs above the instep and achilles to make pulling them on even easier.<\/p>"}},"5ed82b7a-fcfd-4739-8c38-070a20a05fc7":{"type":"custom-text","settings":{"border_bottom":false,"heading":"","description":"","text_alignment":"text-left","background":"","pd_top_dt":10,"pd_bottom_dt":24,"pd_top_tl":36,"pd_bottom_tl":36,"pd_top_mb":20,"pd_bottom_mb":20}},"0538c792-886b-470f-951c-3f6d97e8d8c6":{"type":"feature-collection","settings":{"title":"Explore the range","featured_collection":"bobux-kids-shoes","number_of_products_to_show":5}},"b1684bdc-5dd0-495e-9619-af7cf7d87382":{"type":"custom-text","settings":{"border_bottom":false,"heading":"","description":"","text_alignment":"text-left","background":"","pd_top_dt":10,"pd_bottom_dt":24,"pd_top_tl":36,"pd_bottom_tl":36,"pd_top_mb":18,"pd_bottom_mb":20}},"fff5a3b0-88f6-49f4-92ce-305a4fee55ba":{"type":"delivery-text","settings":{"text":"<h2>CLARKS & SUREFIT (United Kingdom):<\/h2><p><a href=\"\/collections\/clarks\" title=\"Clarks\">Clarks<\/a> and <a href=\"\/collections\/surefit\" title=\"Surefit\">Surefit<\/a> are both UK brands which means that their sizing is similar and fairly true to size. One of the most popular boots each Winter is the Surefit Mani boot. This style is more of a shallow fit in comparison to the Bobux Jodhpur boot and comes with a spare pair of innersoles for little ones with a shallow instep or narrow foot. The first innersole is a removeable leather innersole with a toe outline – this way it is easy to take out, place underneath your child’s foot and track their growth over the season. The second innersole is foam and so it is recommended to be placed underneath the standard leather innersole. With leather on the outside and material-lining for warmth, this style comes in a range of versatile colours every Winter. Many Clarks styles include two innersoles also,  but serve a completely different purpose to the two Surefit innersoles. Unlike Surefit, the dual innersole styles are of average (E) width as the standard. Once the first innersole is removed the shoe becomes a wider fit catering to an array of widths. Clarks styles often include pull tab boots, self-fastening straps, zips or laces or all of the above in one style! Self-fastening straps and laces provide a range of adjustability to suit all widths and depths from narrow to wide, shallow to high. Most lace up style boots also have a zipper – this means that once the boot is on and laces are adjusted to suit, the zipper can be used to get the shoe on and off without using the laces every single time. Self-fastening straps can be more accessible for little ones who don’t know how to tie their laces yet and again provide greater adjustability.<\/p><p><\/p>"}},"bbd941dd-f5e8-4be6-993d-9c76f5dbbd96":{"type":"image-with-text","blocks":{"c6bbe946-e9be-4ca7-9bc1-ccccb23e408d":{"type":"img_text_inside","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/203154_216-E_03.jpg","radius_image":false,"overlay":"#4d4d4d","opacity":2,"text_color":"#ffffff","title":"Clarks Boots","button":"View Range","url":"shopify:\/\/collections\/clarks","new_tab":false}},"f389adb3-ac6c-43ec-8a47-2a7b102940f5":{"type":"img_text_inside","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/SSF032_QK4_04.jpg","radius_image":false,"overlay":"#4d4d4d","opacity":2,"text_color":"#ffffff","title":"Surefit Boots","button":"View Range","url":"shopify:\/\/collections\/surefit","new_tab":false}}},"block_order":["c6bbe946-e9be-4ca7-9bc1-ccccb23e408d","f389adb3-ac6c-43ec-8a47-2a7b102940f5"],"settings":{"border_bottom":false,"enable_slider":false,"layout_block":false,"link_button":"","heading":"","background":"","enable_button":false,"btn_gap_top_dt":40,"btn_gap_top_mb":35,"heading_gap_top_dt":32,"heading_gap_top_mb":32,"section_gap_between_dt":40,"section_gap_between_mb":18,"column_desktop":2,"gap_desktop":6,"pd_top_dt":58,"pd_bottom_dt":62,"column_tablet":2,"gap_tablet":4,"pd_top_tl":36,"pd_bottom_tl":36,"column_mobile":1,"gap_mobile":4,"pd_top_mb":20,"pd_bottom_mb":34}},"7e7ce39b-ea1b-4ffe-ad43-1d617bf4c8cd":{"type":"delivery-text","settings":{"text":"<h2><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">OLD SOLES (Australia):<\/span><\/h2><p><a href=\"\/collections\/old-soles\" title=\"Old Soles\">Old Soles<\/a> boots are often known as a deeper boot (Old Soles Mary Janes on the other hand tend to run shallower).
