Word-of-mouth spread fast (even pre-social media days) and our customer base grew quickly as people everywhere wanted the best for their kid’s feet.More stores opened, and then in 1996, Shoes & Sox opened its first Melbourne store in the Malvern Central Shopping Centre. This meant taking our operations to a new level if we were to guarantee a consistent approach and level of professional fitting no matter which store you visited.We then committed to opening new stores in areas that were under-serviced for professionally fitted children’s shoes. Our range continued to develop and our buying power improved with scale, allowing us to pass on even better value to our customers. In 2022, we celebrated our 44th store opening at Westfield Westfield North Lakes in Queensland. In 2016, we partnered with Myer to launch Shoes & Sox Concession Stores in over 40 Myer stores across Australia. Today, we continue to deliver on that original mission to provide professionally fitted children’s shoes from around the world at great prices for Australian families.","button":"","url":"","button2":"","url2":"","new_tab":false}}},"block_order":["717c7459-865b-49c3-91ee-1c47c7e27cc4","c648b967-3a46-41ad-9cb9-052732a580e7"],"settings":{"border_bottom":false,"enable_slider":false,"layout_block":true,"link_button":"","heading":"","background":"","enable_button":false,"btn_gap_top_dt":40,"btn_gap_top_mb":40,"heading_gap_top_dt":32,"heading_gap_top_mb":32,"section_gap_between_dt":48,"section_gap_between_mb":48,"column_desktop":2,"gap_desktop":6,"pd_top_dt":0,"pd_bottom_dt":0,"column_tablet":1,"gap_tablet":4,"pd_top_tl":0,"pd_bottom_tl":0,"column_mobile":1,"gap_mobile":4,"pd_top_mb":0,"pd_bottom_mb":0}},"fde6c4b1-105a-4524-bf0f-b92e9ff27102":{"type":"template-about","blocks":{"9ac4a545-55f7-4349-a6ef-567142ba1e3f":{"type":"img_text_below","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/UPS_ICONS_200X200PX-03.jpg","image_mobile":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/UPS_ICONS_200X200PX-03.jpg","radius_image":true,"overlay":"","opacity":0,"text_color":"#1f1f1f","description_color":"#1f1f1f","title":"Range of Leading Brands","description":"We stock possibly the largest range of children’s shoes in Australia.
