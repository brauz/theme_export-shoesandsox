Their sizing… and they’re both known for their support! <a href=\"\/collections\/asics-kids-shoes\" title=\"Asics Kids Shoes\">Asics<\/a> and <a href=\"\/collections\/new-balance\" title=\"New Balance\">New Balance<\/a> are in US sizing but tend to run small. This means when we measure (in UK), we firstly go up one size and then convert to US sizing (this means we’ve added two sizes to our<br\/>initial measure, but don’t be alarmed, it’s all about conversion!). Within Asics and New Balance there are styles that can run smaller or larger than others, but this is the same with any brand. The most important thing when on the hunt for a new pair of runners is the technology that goes into each style!<br\/>Each style or range in both Asics and New Balance provides different support focusing on varying needs from pronation, supination, stability, comfort, structure and more! <\/p><p>Asics and New Balance styles tend to have more structure and so the foot is going to move to how the shoe is made. For example, for a child that pronates (rolls in) the GT-1000 (which has arch support) would be recommended to counter the rolling in occurring at the arch. Therefore, the alignment of the foot should alter based on the technology and support provided in the shoe. <\/p>"}},"87a8d6ac-2056-4a1c-8e10-009c2101c25e":{"type":"image-with-text","blocks":{"a037954d-ebd4-49b1-8a74-3c25dbc2db16":{"type":"img_text_inside","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/SAS299_L1B_04.jpg","radius_image":false,"overlay":"#4d4d4d","opacity":2,"text_color":"#ffffff","title":"Asics","button":"View Range","url":"shopify:\/\/collections\/asics-kids-shoes","new_tab":false}},"efa38cbf-70b3-4ebb-a0db-8bed32536aa9":{"type":"img_text_inside","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/SNB174_AJ2-M__3.jpg","radius_image":false,"overlay":"#4d4d4d","opacity":2,"text_color":"#ffffff","title":"New Balance","button":"View Range","url":"shopify:\/\/collections\/new-balance","new_tab":false}}},"block_order":["a037954d-ebd4-49b1-8a74-3c25dbc2db16","efa38cbf-70b3-4ebb-a0db-8bed32536aa9"],"settings":{"border_bottom":false,"enable_slider":false,"layout_block":false,"link_button":"","heading":"","background":"","enable_button":false,"btn_gap_top_dt":40,"btn_gap_top_mb":35,"heading_gap_top_dt":32,"heading_gap_top_mb":32,"section_gap_between_dt":40,"section_gap_between_mb":18,"column_desktop":2,"gap_desktop":6,"pd_top_dt":58,"pd_bottom_dt":62,"column_tablet":2,"gap_tablet":4,"pd_top_tl":36,"pd_bottom_tl":36,"column_mobile":1,"gap_mobile":4,"pd_top_mb":20,"pd_bottom_mb":34}},"fff5a3b0-88f6-49f4-92ce-305a4fee55ba":{"type":"delivery-text","settings":{"text":"<h2><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">NIKE & ADIDAS:<\/span><\/h2><p>These brands run true to US sizing!
